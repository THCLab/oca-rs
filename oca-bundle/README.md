#### In cargo package

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
oca-bundle = "0.4.0"
```

### Build

Building local package:  
`cargo build `

### Run [tests](tests)

`cargo test`

## Bindings

To use oca in other languages, checkout [oca-bindings](https://github.com/THCLab/oca-bindings).

## Releasing new version

`cargo release`  
bumps version and runs `git push` with `v{version}` tag added.
That triggers actions on github
([Crates.io][Crates.io actions] and [npmjs.com][npmjs.com actions])
which build and publish packages on [crates.io][crates.io] and [npmjs.com][npmjs.com].
